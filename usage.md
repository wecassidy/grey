If you use that link, you will get whatever I happened to push to the repo last.

Please don't overuse the Beta and Dev styles as I would rather not have it throttled/blacklisted.

Alternatively, you could just copy the CSS from the latest commit to the `master`, `beta`, or `develop` branch for the latest release, beta, or dev CSS, respectively.
