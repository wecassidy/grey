Grey
====

A repo for the Grey style for AoPS blogs.

The mostest officialest AoPS thread for the style is <a href=http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=624&t=583927>here</a>. It contains release notes and known bugs. I would appreciate any reports of bugs that I missed.

The recommended way to use this style is as follows:
```css
/*
Grey
In lieu of a better name.

This theme was inspired by NeoMathematicalKid's Fresh, PythonNut's Libre, and asf's Wordpress Dusk to
Dawn. Thanks to NeoMathematicalKid, PythonNut, knittingfrenzy18, asf, and the folks at MDN for helping me to learn CSS.

*/

@import "http://tungsten.site40.net/css/grey.css";
```

To get the latest, greatest, wonderfully buggy version, try:
```css

@import "https://rawgit.com/Tungsten314/grey/master/custom.css";
```

Please don't overuse the second link as I would rather not have it throttled/blacklisted.

If you really, really want it, you can also just grab the entire CSS from custom.css, but it isn't recommended, as you won't get any updates as they come along the ~~yellow brick road~~ pipeline.
