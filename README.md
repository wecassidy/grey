Grey version 1.2.1 (beta)
====

A repo for the Grey style for AoPS blogs.

The mostest officialest AoPS thread for the style is [here](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=624&t=583927). It contains release notes and known bugs. I would appreciate any reports of bugs that I missed.

This style was written using the SCSS dialect of the SASS CSS preprocessor.

If you want to use this CSS on your blog, see the [usage](/usage.md) page.

## Changes:
beta/1.2.1: icons on the widget bar go away at certain window sizes to avoid overlaps.
